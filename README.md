This project was an exciting step in understanding how JavaScript can be used to create interactive applications.

The app uses prompt to take input from the user.
A simple while loop runs to keep the app functional until the user chooses to quit.
Tasks are stored in an array, and array methods like .push() and .splice() handle adding and deleting tasks.
